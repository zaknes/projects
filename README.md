# Projects

I wanted a place to share little things that I've done, so I created this repository. It is mostly for simple website designs, concepts, recreations, or ideas. This repository is ongoing and has no end in sight.

I hope that some of the things found in here can inspire you or give you ideas. Feel free to use whatever you'd like; if you use anything found in this repository, let me know; I'd love to see!
