# Projects

I wanted a place to throw random projects I work on. These usually tend to be small experiments, testing out designs, proof-of-concepts, etc. and are not expected to be used in their immediate form. If you happen to come across anything interesting or useful in here, feel free to use it.

## Tailwind Projects
- **Base** ([Site](https://zaknesler.github.io/projects/css/tailwind/base/public/), [Code](css/tailwind/base)) &mdash; Skeleton Tailwind project I will often use for testing.
- **Google** ([Site](https://zaknesler.github.io/projects/css/tailwind/recreations/google/public/), [Code](css/tailwind/recreations/google)) &mdash; A recreation of the Google search results page with simple Vue tab selection.
