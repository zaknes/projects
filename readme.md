I wanted a place to throw random projects I work on. These usually tend to be small experiments, testing out designs, proof-of-concepts, etc. If you happen to come across anything interesting or useful in here, feel free to use it.

### Tailwind Projects
- **Base** ([Site](https://zaknesler.github.io/projects/css/tailwind/base/public/), [Code](css/tailwind/base)) &mdash; Skeleton Tailwind project I will often use for testing
- **Google Clone** ([Site](https://zaknesler.github.io/projects/css/tailwind/google/public/), [Code](css/tailwind/google)) &mdash; A recreation of the Google search results page with simple Vue tab selection
- **Paddle Register Page** ([Site](https://zaknesler.github.io/projects/css/tailwind/paddle-register/public/), [Code](css/tailwind/paddle-register)) &mdash; A recreation of the [Paddle Register page](https://vendors.paddle.com/signup) because I think it's pretty
- **Reddit Clone** ([Site](https://zaknesler.github.io/projects/css/tailwind/ribbit/public/), [Code](css/tailwind/ribbit)) &mdash; A near-identical clone of the ever-popular site [Reddit](https://reddit.com) using zero CSS
