## About

A recreation of the ever-popular site Reddit using Tailwind CSS and VueJS. It is a demonstration of how to create complex UIs with zero CSS, using only Tailwind CSS and its configuration file.

The icons used on this site come from [Heroicons.dev](https://heroicons.dev) and were created by [Steve Schoger](https://steveschoger.com).
