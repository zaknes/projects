## Base Tailwind Project

This is a skeleton Tailwind project that can be used for basic projects. It uses Laravel Mix to handle asset bundling as well as PurgeCSS to shrink file sizes.

I use this mainly for mocking up simple designs with Tailwind, usually without using Javascript, although this starter project makes it easy to drop in your favorite framework.

### Get Started

1. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager:

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install

    # Using Yarn
    yarn
    ```

2. Use the predefined `watch` script to watch for changes you make:

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm run watch

    # Using Yarn
    yarn watch
    ```

### Build Assets

To build assets, simply run the build script:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run build

# Using Yarn
yarn build
```
